If you want to consolidate payday loans, you’ll need to apply for a personal loan from a credit union, online lender or bank.

Once approved for a personal loan, you’ll receive a lump sum of money that you'll use to pay off your payday lenders. You’ll then make monthly payments on your new personal loan until that loan is paid in full.
