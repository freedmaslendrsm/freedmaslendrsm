Payday loans are expensive, high-interest loans with short repayment periods that can be difficult to repay on time. Borrowers unable to make payments may opt to roll over their loan for a fee. With enough rollovers, this could mean owing more than the initial loan amount.

If youâ€™re struggling to manage multiple payday loan payments, payday loan consolidation may be an option to consider.
What is payday loan consolidation?

Payday loan consolidation is when you combine multiple existing payday loans under one new personal loan, which you pay off in monthly installments at a lower interest rate.

By consolidating payday loans with a lower-interest personal loan, you can have a longer repayment period and small monthly payments that are easier to manage. In addition, having just one loan payment can feel less overwhelming and help you stick to your debt payoff plan.
